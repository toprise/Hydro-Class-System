Hydro is a high-performance online judge system.  
It is easy to deploy (with install script), light weight and extensible.  
Also see previous version at [vijos/vj4](https://github.com/vijos/vj4)

Now we have a SaaS service running at [https://hydro.ac](https://hydro.ac). (Fully free of charge!)  
You can easily have a glance at the features of the system and try it out.  
You can also just use the service without self-hosting the system with the powerful `domain` feature.  
Feel free to create an account and then navigate to `MyAccount > MyDomains > Create Domain` to create one.
